---@return FicsIt_Networks.Components.ComputerCase_C
function computer.getInstance() end

--- Stops the current code execution immediately and queues the system to restart in the next tick.
function computer.reset() end

--- Stops the current code execution.
--- Basically kills the PC runtime immediately.
function computer.stop() end

--- Crashes the computer with the given error message.
---@param errorMsg string The crash error message you want to use
function computer.panic(errorMsg) end

--- This function is mainly used to allow switching to a higher tick runtime state. Usually you use this when you want to make your code run faster when using functions that can run in asynchronous environment.
function computer.skip() end

--- Does the same as computer.skip
--- ### Not in Documentation. ###
function computer.promote() end

--- Reverts effects of skip
--- ### Not in Documentation. ###
function computer.demote() end

---@alias FicsIt_Networks.Computer.State
---|0 # Sync
---|1 # Async

--- If computer state is async probably after calling computer.skip.

--- Lets the computer emit a simple beep sound with the given pitch.
---@param pitch number The pitch of the beep sound you want to play.
function computer.beep(pitch) end


--- Sets the code of the current eeprom. Doesnâ€™t cause a system reset.
---@param code string The code you want to place into the eeprom.
function computer.setEEPROM(code) end


--- Returns the code the current eeprom contents.
---@return string code The code in the EEPROM
function computer.getEEPROM() end


--- Returns the number of game seconds passed since the save got created. A game day consists of 24 game hours, a game hour consists of 60 game minutes, a game minute consists of 60 game seconds.
---@return number time The number of game seconds passed since the save got created.
function computer.time() end


--- Returns the amount of milliseconds passed since the system started.
---@return integer milliseconds Amount of milliseconds since system start
function computer.millis() end


--- Returns some kind of strange/mysterious time data from a unknown place (the real life).
---@return integer Timestamp Unix Timestamp
---@return string DateTimeStamp Serverside Formated Date-Time-Stamp
---@return string DateTimeStamp Date-Time-Stamp after ISO 8601

--- This function allows you to get all installed PCI-Devices in a computer of a given type.
---@param type FicsIt_Networks.Class
