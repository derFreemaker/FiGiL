|===

This IO-Module allows you to display static text.
You can change the font size dynamically and you can even switch between a monospace font and a "normal" one.

Even if you miss alot features a GPU would provide, the convience of it is, that you are not required
to have a GPU, so it is more like a plug and play experience.
