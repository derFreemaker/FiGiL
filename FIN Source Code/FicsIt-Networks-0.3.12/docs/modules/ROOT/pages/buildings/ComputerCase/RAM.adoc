You can add an unlimited amount of these RAM module to your computer
to increase the memory capacity of the computer.

Memory gets consumed by the nodes you put into tmpfs, the amount of memory used by a processor.
That means you can optimize your code to decrease the memory consumption.

If you try to use more memory than available, the system will crash with a out of memory exception.
