= Computer Case
:description: The computer case is the core of computer technology. It allows you to build a custom PC with modules to make a computer that fits your needs.

The Computer Case allows you to build dynamically a computer with different modules.
Each module provides then a functionality you might need like a processor or RAM.
The Computer Case is like the mother board which connects all the different modules together
and is then capable of running programs.

It also manages the xref:items/EEPROM.adoc[EEPROM], you need at least one xref:items/EEPROM.adoc[EEPROM] which then holds the boot code of the computer.
The type of xref:items/EEPROM.adoc[EEPROM] varies between processor types, because different processors use different types of code.

You need exactly one processor for the computer case to work.

== Computer Modules
Computer modules provide different additional features to a computer. +
A CPU f.e. decides how the computer will process data and what kind of xref:items/EEPROM.adoc[EEPROMs] are allowed.
Multiple xref:buildings/ComputerCase/RAM.adoc[RAM modules] can be used to increase the internal memory of the computer. +
The computer case provides a slot places wer you can place these modules with the build gun.
You can freely arrange these modules and fully customize your computer this way.

== CPUs
You can only install one CPU into each computer case.
This CPU then decides how the computer will process data and actually run a program.
The Lua CPU f.e. allows you to execute Lua programs. Since the underlying data structure my vary between implementations, the installed CPU also decides which xref:items/EEPROM.adoc[EEPROMs] can be used in the computer.

== PCI-Interface
The PCI-Interface of a computer allows addressing/referencing computer components directly. +
`PCI-Devices` is the name for this kind computer components. +
This Interface usually is exposed by the computers kernel and the specific CPU implementation.
It should provide a function that allows you to retrieve a list of,
in the computer case currently installed PCI-Devices of a given type. +
Have a look at xref:/lua/examples/PCIDevices.adoc[this] example to see how it is done in Lua.
