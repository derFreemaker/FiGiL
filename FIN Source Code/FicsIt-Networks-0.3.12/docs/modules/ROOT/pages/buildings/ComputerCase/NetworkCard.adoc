This computer module ia a network card that allows for intercomputer communication
in form of pakets you can send over the network.

The communication happens in channels from 0 to 10000. If you want to recieve network messages
you will need to open the channel and then you can use the signal system to get the signals from
the network card. Network messages are limited to 7 custom parameters and additionally
the channel number and the sender address.
The sender address has to be  the other network card's ID, not the ID of the computer.

You can only create a instance of a network card when you try to instantiate it from the computer
it is placed on.
