The Lua Processor allows you to run Lua Code and requires a Lua EEPROM for boot code.
This code is like the BIOS for your computer.
The Lua Processor uses the xref:lua/index.adoc[Lua Interface] so you can code complex programs
interacting with your factory.

The different tiers of CPUs provide different speeds of code execution.
Limiting the execution time of a CPU works by limiting the amount of lua code increments
executed per factory tick. While such a tick occures it goes through two tick states.
The first state simply runs a couple of code increments unlimited.
After this amount of code increments it enters the second state which will cause
the tick to end when a API call (not standard Lua function) occurs.
But when the tick doesn't end until a specific amount of code increments occur,
the system will crash with a out of time exception.
That means, when you make a infinite loop without any api calls.
The system will crash, but if you do a API call like print(), it will run as intended.

Rightnow this code executions occurs in the factory tick and so synced with the game.
And so provides thread safety.
