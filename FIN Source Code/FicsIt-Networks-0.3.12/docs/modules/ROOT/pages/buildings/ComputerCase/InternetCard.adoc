The Internet Card is a xref:buildings/ComputerCase/index.adoc#_pci_interface[PCI-Device] you can place into a computer case and is available over xref:buildings/ComputerCase/index.adoc#_pci_interface[PCI-Interface].

The Internet Card is a rather simple device not providing any big functionality.

The whole internet card can be used, to do http requests in every shape imaginable.

With this, you can f.e. download pastebin scripts or communicate with a custom REST Server.

*Planned Features*
- Make it optional by config file for security reasons
- Add socket connection support

== Do a HTTP-Request
To do make http requests you can use the `request` function. +
This function simply takes as first argument the URL you want to send the request to.
As second argument it takes the request method (like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, etc.).
As third argument it takes the body (aka. content) you want to send in the http request
(leave it empty if there is non, like when you do just a get request). +
The function is a var-args function, so you can now pass additional parameters to the function.
The request function now requires additional parameters in pairs of two strings.
The first string of a pair is a header name of an additional header you might want to send.
The second string of a pair is the value of that header. +
The function will return a future-struct which you can check or wait if the response got received, you can then get the request data like the response body.

WARNING: When sending data in the request body, you *ALWAYS* have to define the `Content-Type` header field, otherwise the function will fail.

Have a look at xref:lua/examples/InternetCard.adoc[this] example to see how it is done in Lua.
