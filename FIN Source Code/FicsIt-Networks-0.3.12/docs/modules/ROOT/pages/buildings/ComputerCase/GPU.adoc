This is the base type of all GPUs.

The GPU allows you to render graphics which can then be displayed by a Screen.
For that a GPU needs to get bound to a screen and vice versa.
You can only bind one GPU to one screen and vice versa at the same time.

A screen doesn't influence the functionality of rendering but a screen
might take effect on how it get displayed like some weird colors or
if it gets rendered in the world or just as a UI element.

Because the GPUs rendering processes might vary, they might have
different functions and signals provided.
But there are a couple which are implemented by every GPU.
