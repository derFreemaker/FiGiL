The Drive Holder allows you to insert different Drives.
The plugedin drive will then have a DeviceNode in the DevDevice of the system.

This holder has two states for the drive, locked and unlocked.
Only if a drive is locked it will be added to the DevDevice, else it is not.

To lock it, you will need to put the drive into the UI and then move the lock handle up,
until the Red Lock lights up.

When you want to take the drive, you need slide the handle all the way to the bottom,
so it is not anymore in the way and you will be able to take out the drive via drag'n'drop.
