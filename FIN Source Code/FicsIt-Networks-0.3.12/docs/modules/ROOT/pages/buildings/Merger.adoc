The merger allows you to control the flow of items.

It has one output queue that can be filled from the input to up to two items.
Those get then transfered to the conveyor at the output connector.

You can transfer items from on of the inputs to the output if the given input has a item and the output queue has fewer than two items.

Each input queue gets automaticaly filled by the attached conveyor with up to two values.
You can then decide for each input when the first item in the queue get transfered to the output.
