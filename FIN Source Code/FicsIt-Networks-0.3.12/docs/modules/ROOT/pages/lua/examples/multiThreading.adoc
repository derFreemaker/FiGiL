= Multi Threading Example

This example shows a usage of the coroutine.resume additions.
It is a small thread manager whith some usage of threads.

== Setup

You simply need a computer with a Lua Processor and some RAM as well as a EEPROM filled
with the code listed below.

== Output

This code will execute "Hey" and "Ho" switching after each other indefinetly.

Notice how this are actually two different coroutines running "at the same time".

== Code

[source,Lua]
----
thread = {
 threads = {},
 current = 1
}

function thread.create(func)
 local t = {}
 t.co = coroutine.create(func)
 function t:stop()
  for i,th in pairs(thread.threads) do
   if th == t then
    table.remove(thread.threads, i)
   end
  end
 end
 table.insert(thread.threads, t)
 return t
end

function thread:run()
 while true do
  if #thread.threads < 1 then
   return
  end
  if thread.current > #thread.threads then
   thread.current = 1
  end
  coroutine.resume(true, thread.threads[thread.current].co)
  thread.current = thread.current + 1
 end
end


-- example 

function sleep()
 event.pull(0.0)
end

function foo1()
 while true do
  sleep()
  print("hey")
 end
end

function foo2()
 while true do
  sleep()
  print("ho")
 end
end

t1 = thread.create(foo1)
t2 = thread.create(foo2)

thread.run()
