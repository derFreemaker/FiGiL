= Lua Internet Card Example

First we should use the xref:buildings/ComputerCase/index.adoc#_pci_interface[PCI-Interface] of the computer to get a reference to our xref:buildings/ComputerCase/InternetCard.adoc[Internet Card].
You can use this snippet anytime when you have an Internet-Card installed.
```Lua
local card = computer.getPCIDevices(findClass("FINInternetCard"))[1]
```

This example downloads with a `GET` request some data from GitHub a json-serialization library and saves it into a file, so we can load the library from now on when we need it in this computer.

```Lua
-- get internet card
local card = computer.getPCIDevices(findClass("FINInternetCard"))[1]

-- get library from internet
local req = card:request("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rxi/json.lua/master/json.lua", "GET", "")
local _, libdata = req:await()

-- save library to filesystem
filesystem.initFileSystem("/dev")
filesystem.makeFileSystem("tmpfs", "tmp")
filesystem.mount("/dev/tmp","/")
local file = filesystem.open("json.lua", "w")
file:write(libdata)
file:close()

-- load the library from the file system and use it
local json = filesystem.doFile("json.lua")

local data = {
  somekey = "is stuff",
  otherkey = 42
}

print(json.encode(data))
```

This is an example that sends with a `POST` request some data to a web server which will send this data back again.

```Lua
local card = computer.getPCIDevices(findClass("FINInternetCard"))[1]

local req = card:request("https://httpbin.org/anything", "POST", "hey ho!!!", "Content-Type", "text")

print(req:await())
```
