= Drive Example

This example shows how to manipulating drives.

== Setup

All you need is a basic computer (had Lua Processor, RAM and EEPROM in it) and a Drive mounted on its Disk Holder.

== Find all the Drives

The code below should print all UUIDs of installed drives.

=== Code

[source,Lua]
----
-- Shorten name
fs = filesystem
-- Initialize /dev
if fs.initFileSystem("/dev") == false then
    computer.panic("Cannot initialize /dev")
end
-- List all the drives
for _, drive in pairs(fs.childs("/dev")) do
    print(drive)
end
----

You might notice there is a "serial" beside your drives, it is the console under the code editor. We recommend you just ignoring it, or you can filtering it out as the code shown below.

[source, Lua]
----
-- Shorten name
fs = filesystem
-- Initialize /dev
if fs.initFileSystem("/dev") == false then
    computer.panic("Cannot initialize /dev")
end

drives = fs.childs("/dev")

-- Filtering out "serial"
for idx, drive in pairs(drives) do
    if drive == "serial" then table.remove(drives, idx) end
end

-- List all the drives
for i = 1, #drives do
    print(drives[i])
end
----

== Mount a Drive

This program shows how to mount your drive to the root mountpoint.

[source, Lua]
----
-- Shorten name
fs = filesystem
-- Initialize /dev
if fs.initFileSystem("/dev") == false then
    computer.panic("Cannot initialize /dev")
end
-- Let say UUID of the drive is 7A4324704A53821154104A87BE5688AC
disk_uuid = "7A4324704A53821154104A87BE5688AC"
-- Mount our drive to root
fs.mount("/dev/"..disk_uuid, "/")
----

== Accessing Drives with Windows Explorer

All drives are located at `%LocalAppData%\FactoryGame\Saved\SaveGames\Computers`
