= FileSystem API
:description: The FileSystem API allows you to manage a virtual file system.

The filesystem api provides structures, functions and variables for interacting with the virtual file systems.

You can't access files outside the virtual filesystem. If you try to do so, the Lua runtime crashes.

== Virtual File System

FicsIt-Networks implements it's own virtual filesystem for UNIX like experience using the FileSystem.

The file system consists of nodes. Such a node can be a File, a Folder or something else.
Each nodes is able to have child nodes and might be able to get opened with a file stream.
A folder also delivers an abstract interface for adding and removing nodes.
A Device implements lookup functions for searching for nodes in the filesystem structure.
Such a device can be a temporary filesystem  (tmpfs) which exists only in memory
and which will get purged on a system reboot, or f.e. a disk filesystem (drives)
which store the nodes on the real virtual filesystem in a folder.
You can then mount such a device to a location in the root filesystem tree
so when you now access a path, the filesystem looks first for the device
and uses then the remaining path to get the node data from the device.

There is also a DriveNode which simply holds a reference to a drive so you can access a
drive via the filesystem. You can use then the mount function to mount the Drive of a
DriveNode to the given location in the filesystem tree.

Because you need at least one drive mounted to even be able to access any node,
we provide the initFileSystem function which you can call only once in a system session.
This functions will then mount the DevDevice to the given location.

The DevDevice is a sepcial Device which holds all the DeviceNodes representing Device
attached to the computer session, like hard drives, tempfs and the serial I/O.

== Functions

=== `bool initFileSystem(string path)`

Trys to mount the system DevDevice to the given location.

The DevDevice is special Device holding DeviceNodes for all filesystems added to the system.
(like TmpFS and drives). It is unmountable as well as getting mounted a seccond time.

== File

Represents a filestream for reading and writing from and to a file in the virtual filesystem.

Reimplemented from the Lua standard library. https://www.lua.org/pil/21.1.html[Here you can find more].
