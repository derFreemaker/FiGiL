= 8. Using Reflection

The Reflection System is a system that allows to get data about
functions, classes, properties and structs.

It contains information about their structure, parameters of functions and other
technical and structural data as well as metadata like descriptions and
localized display names of the different things.

This data is heavily used internally and also can be accessed from within Lua code.

== Reflection Data in Lua
The mentioned `findClass` function allows you to search for a class by its name.
It returns an instance of a class containing information about it.
[source, lua]
local class = findClass("NetworkCard")

This instance contains functions and properties that allow you to get
information about the class it represents. +
It extends from Struct, and it extends from ReflectionBase, the base type of all reflection data classes. +
xref::Reflection.adoc#Class-ReflectionBase[ReflectionBase]:

* name (property) +
 The internal name of the data object as a string. f.e. the function name you use in Lua.
* displayName (property) +
 A display name with better and more human-readable text of the object.
* description (property) +
 A human-readable description explaining what the data object does. +
 (f.e. functionality of the function, uses of the class)

The "Struct" Class provides functions and properties about a struct specifically.
Like what properties and what functions the Struct it Represents has. +
Check the xref::Reflection.adoc#Class-Struct[Reference] for more details.

The "Class" Class provides the finally additionally information
about signals a instance of this class might emit.
Check the xref::Reflection.adoc#Class-Class[Reference] for more details.

== Using Reflection Viewer and Reference
As Reflection Viewer we mean the "Reflection" Tab in the computer case UI
or the network manager tool, that shows all available types, functions, etc.

As Reflection Reference we mean the xref::Reflection.adoc[Reflection] page
in this web documentation.

Both of these, list all the contents of the reflection system language independent. +
That's why you won't find stuff like the component or event API in here,
because this stuff is language (Lua) dependent.

The reflection viewer can show all data of class and its inherited functions etc.
all on one page, the reflection reference can not. +
You can disable this behaviour of the reflection viewer in the bottom right corner.

Let's try to read the reflection data.

We want to first, read the Recipe of a Constructor and prints its name to the console,
after that we want to get a signal whenever Item got outputted and print something.

At first, lets search for a constructor in the reflection data. +
You won't be able to find it in the online documentation,
as it will unnecessarily bloat it, but you can find it in the in-game
reflection viewer.

On the left you can see of which classes the constructor extends from. +
On of these is the "Manufacturer" Class. Let's have a look at it. +
This time it is also available on the online documentation:
====
include::page$Reflection.adoc[tag=Class-Manufacturer__title,leveloffset=-10]
====

Since we first want to get a recipe lets search for a function or property,
that could do that.
====
include::page$Reflection.adoc[tag=Class-Manufacturer-Funcs-getRecipe__title,leveloffset=-10]
====

You can read a description and other information. +
The flags "RuntimeSync" and "RuntimeParallel" show that we can
only use the function in the non-promoted Lua tick state. +
What that exactly means will be discussed in a later section.

The title consists of: +
**Display Name** internalName (Parameter, List) +
The display name is a human readable name of the function. +
The internal name is used f.e. inside lua as function name. +
The parameter list are all arguments and return values of the function. +
Parameters with the `out` keyword are return values. +
You can have multiple return values.

Parameters are further down described in the `Parameter` and `Return Values` section.

We can see that a instance of a manufacturer (which a instance of constructor is),
has a member function `getRecipe` that returns a Class Instance of a Recipe.
[source,lua]
----
local manufacturer = component.proxy(...)
local recipe = manufacturer:getRecipe()
----

You can click on the link of the parameter type to get redirected
to the reference of that type.

====
include::page$Reflection.adoc[tag=Class-Recipe__title,leveloffset=-10]
====

Here you can find a couple of functions and properties that have
the `ClassFunc` or `ClassProp` flag. +
This flag describes that it is available when you have a class instance of that type.

We want the `name` property as it gives us the name of the recipe.

[source,lua]
print(recipe.name)

Now we want to figure out how we can get a signal when an item gets outputted.

Let's search further one of the parents of our Manufacturer.
====
include::page$Reflection.adoc[tag=Class-Actor__title,leveloffset=-10]
====

The actor class has an interesting function `getFactoryConnectors`. +
Let's check the return type of it:
====
include::page$Reflection.adoc[tag=Class-FactoryConnection__title,leveloffset=-10]
====

Well, look at that, it has a `ItemTransfer` Signal. +
And when looking at the description, it does exactly what we want.

So lets use the information we got from the reflection and write some code
that gets a factory connector, and then listen to it.

We don't know which of the factory connectors the `getFactoriesConnector` returns. +
They will always be in the same order on a per building type basis. +
So we simply have to test which of the connectors is the output connector
for all constructors, and listen to that one.

[source,lua]
----
local connector = manufacturer:getFactoryConnectors()[1]
event.listen(connector)
----

So, now we can pull events and print the `ItemTransfer` event to the console.

[source,lua]
while true do
 e, s, i = event.pull()
 if e == "ItemTransfer" then
  print("Transfer!", i)
 end
end

Our full code yet would be:
[source,lua]
----
local manufacturer = component.proxy(...)
local recipe = manufacturer:getRecipe()

print(recipe.name)

local connector = manufacturer:getFactoryConnectors()[1]
event.listen(connector)

while true do
 e, s, i = event.pull()
 if e == "ItemTransfer" then
  print("Transfer!", i)
 end
end
----
