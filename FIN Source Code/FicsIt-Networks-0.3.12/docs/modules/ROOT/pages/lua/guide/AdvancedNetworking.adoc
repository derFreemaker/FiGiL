Now we can access our storage container easily using the proxy function
and a hard-coded UUID string.
As already mentioned, is this not a good approach to get a reference to a component.
Instead, we want a more dynamic way of referencing our components.

== Using component nicks
We can use the component nicks to reference the components more dynamically.

For this we can use the `findComponent` function of the `component` API.

The `findComponent` function takes in variable amount of arguments,
where each argument is a string containing a nick query. +
Each parameter has a corresponding return value.
These return values are arrays of strings containing the IDs of the components
that mach the given nick query.

As already mentioned, the keywords in the query are space separated
and matching components have to have at least the queried keywords in their nick.

Imagine you have the components A `test meep north`, B `test meep south`, C `test north okay`, D `okay test south`, E `okay`. +
The query `test meep north` matches A. +
The query `test norh` matches A and C. +
The query `okay` matches C, D and E. +
The query `north` matches A and C. +
The query `okay meep` matches nothing.

Here is some sample code using it:
[source,lua]
local comps1, comps2 = component.findComponent("test north", "okay")

You can inline use it with the proxy function to convert the ids into references.

[source,lua]
local comps = component.proxy(component.findComponent("..."))
local comp1 = comps[1] -- access first entry in the array

This works, because as we have learned we can also convert
arrays of strings containing UUIDs into arrays of references.

[TIP]
====
Depending on your network, the `findComponent` function
can return many UUIDs in one array.
Because `proxy` is kinda heavy,
it's recommended you filter the UUID array before you pass it to proxy if possible. +
(this is f.e. the case if you just need 1 or n entries).

This is slow:
[source,lua]
local comp1 = component.proxy(component.findComponent("..."))[1]

This is fast:
[source,lua]
local comp1 = component.proxy(component.findComponent("...")[1])
====

Additionally, you can use an instance of a class instead of the nick-query-string.
This allows you to get all components in the network that are of the given type
represented by the instance of the class (and all components their type extends the given one, "recursive")

You can use the global `findClass` function to get a instance of a class
based on classes name. +
You can get the class names using the reflection viewer.
We will talk about that in more detail later.

Here an example that gets all storage containers in the network:
[source,lua]
local containerIDs = component.findComponent(findClass("FGBuildableStorage"))

== Using findComponent
Let's expand our Item-Count program to sum the Item Count of all storage containers
in the network.

First we need to get all containers.

[source,lua]
local containerIDs = component.findComponent(findClass("FGBuildableStorage"))
local containers = component.proxy(containerIDs)

After that we need to iterate our containers
[source,lua]
for _, container in ipairs(containers) do
    ...
end

Before we iterate the containers we need a variable
to store the sum of all item-counts.
[source,lua]
local sum = 0

Inside the for-loop-body we want to get the first inventory
of the storage container and add the `itemCount` to our `sum` variable.

[source,lua]
sum = sum + container:getInventories()[1].itemCount

Last but not least, we need to print our sum to the console.

[source,lua]
print("Item-Count:", sum)

We should now have a combined code like this:
[source,lua]
----
local containerIDs = component.findComponent(findClass("FGBuildableStorage"))
local containers = component.proxy(containerIDs)

local sum = 0
for _, container in ipairs(containers) do
    sum = sum + container:getInventories()[1].itemCount
end

print("Item-Count:", sum)
----
